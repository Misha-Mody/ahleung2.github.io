# Aaron Leung's Personal Home Page 

Simple personal home page about myself including my story, education and work experience, projects and hobbies.

## Project Objective

Networking and meeting new people is very important both professionally and personally.  Problem is, I am not a big social media user; I rarely use Twitter and I donâ€™t use Instagram etc.  Therefore I want to create a personal webpage that I can give to people if they would like to know me better and possibly contact me in the future.
